# AdministrationProgram
Code will get user test score and gpa to see if they meet requirement to get into a program. The reqirement to get into the program is an 80 in a test with a gpa less than 3. If the applicant gpa is 3.0 or higher then a test score of 60 or higher is required. 

Algorithm 
=
1. The program will ask user to enter their GPA and test score.
2. The program will then use an if/else statement to see if the the user meet the requirement to get into the program. The requiremtn to get into the program is a gpa of 3.0 and a test score of 60 or higher. If the user gpa is less than 3.0 then they need an 80 in the test. 
3. Program will display "You been accepted" to the user if they meet the requirement. If they did not meet the requirement the program will display "We appriciate your interest but you did not meet the requirement."
